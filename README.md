# TAB2XML
Welcome to TAB2XML by group 12! The general overview of the product is for the user to pass through tablature for the instrument of their choice. The imported tablature is then converted into sheet music, where they will have various different options to choose from such as playing the music with a virtual instrument of their choice, pausing/playing the music, saving the sheet music to their personal machine, etc. 

If you have any questions refer to the documents folder where you can find the groups user manual, system requirements, and testing document.
